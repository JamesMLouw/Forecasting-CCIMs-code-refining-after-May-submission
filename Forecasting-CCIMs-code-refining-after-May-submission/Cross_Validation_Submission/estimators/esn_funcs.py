    Methods
    -------
    Train(training_input, training_teacher)
        Performs training using the training input against the training teacher for the ESN
    Forecast(testing_input)
        Performs testing using a new set of testing input. Outputs are generated for this set, which can be tested
        against a corresponding testing_output
    PathContinue(latest_input, nhorizon)
        Simulates forward in time using the latest input for nhorizon period of time
        This requires a training where the training_teacher = training_input, so that the ESN can be run autonomously

        Performs training using the training input against the training teacher

        Parameters
        ----------
        training_input : array_like
            Training input for training the ESN. Must have format (nsamples, ndim)
        training_teacher : array_like
            Training teacher for training the ESN. Must have format (nsamples, ndim)
        use_teacher : boolean
            In the case that use_teacher == False, this uses the data from the dictionary returned in
            the ESN listening stage, rather than the teacher data. Although the two data may be identical,
            the training results are different. To callibrate this with the code used in graphing the ESNs,
            set use_teacher = False.

        Note, for the PathContinue and Forecast tasks, this training only fits the ESN
        to perform these tasks on a trajectory continuing directly on the one on which it
        was trained
